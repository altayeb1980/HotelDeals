# Technology used for HotelDeals project:

Java8 as a programming language
Spring Boot-2.0.4 as a backend
thymeleaf-3.0.9, bootstrap-4.1.3, JQuery 3.3.1 as a frontend
Junit 4 and Mockito
Docker container to run the application
Heroku

## What i learn

bootstrap and thymeleaf and also how to connect to JSON API by using spring boot and the most important this deploy the application to heroku.


## What i want to accomplish for this project:

I tested the backend with unit and mockito only, i want to ensure the behavior for the frontend by simulating the actual
end user interacting with the page in the web browser (clicking buttons and links,
filling in and submitting forms, and so on). For that, i want to write acceptance tests using
Selenium.

Connect my project to travis CI, i want to give the ability after each push to the github the build deployed automatically to target folder on the github.

for heroku i deploy the build by steps manually, i want the build to deployed auomatically to the heroku by usoing the travisCI as well.
